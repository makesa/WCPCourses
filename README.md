# WCPCourses
WCP classes offered.


This project starts in the Home/Index file path.

A user would select a class by selecting the image representing that class.

The session selection is not currently tied to the database but you can click the register button to register your first name, last name and email address.

For the full CRUD permissions, you click on the logo (which sends you back home), select a class click on the ADMIN link which will display a list of registered students that you can view, edit or delete.  ADMIN can also manually add a student to the roster.
